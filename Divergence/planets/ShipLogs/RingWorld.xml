      <Text>After calibrating the interfaces, I was able to remotely connect to something called the Signal Capture Satellite, which is orbiting around the Stranger's term for the Eye of the Universe.</Text>

		  <Text>While it can not be turned off, the approximate location of the Signal Capture Satellite can be broadcasted to the Stranger's light spacecraft. One of the spacecraft is apparently currently in transit, but is too far away from the Stranger for its distress signal to be heard.</Text>

	   <Text>The missing Hearthian explorer, Acetate, stumbled upon the Stranger while scouting a location for the Deep Space Satellite. They managed to get inside, but destroyed their ship in the process, and as such decided to go to the tower further down the river in order to find a more central position for their camp.</Text>

	   <Text>Acetate thought that the secret to reestablishing a connection to the Signal Blocker lies inside of the sealed vault, but they were dismayed at the fact that the codes in the Cinder Isles were destroyed. They then decided to go get some rest at their makeshift "home" in the building that's connected to the dam.</Text>
