      <Page>Didn't Slate tell you? Hornfels headed over to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Radio Tower</color>]]> just a minute ago. Something about the statue opening its eyes reminding them of something? I dunno.</Page>
      <Page>You should have seen them run out of here, though. It was <![CDATA[<i>]]>wild<![CDATA[</i>]]>. I had no idea Hornfels still had that in them.</Page>
