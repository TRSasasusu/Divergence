			<Page>Huh? Is that <![CDATA[<i>]]>shade<![CDATA[</i>]]> you're throwing at me? Because if that is shade I'll have you know that the fuel in those tanks <![CDATA[<i>]]>does<![CDATA[</i>]]> eventually run out, and I'm the one who refuels them, so you better be nice to me.</Page>
			<Page>Not sure what you mean though. If by "random things" you mean "giving pilots actually good advice before their first launch", I guess I do it out of the goodness of my heart, you know?</Page>
			<Page>Also, don't you have something better to do? You know, space? Go harass some other lifeform and accuse them of being random. Maybe an Anglerfish. I'm sure they'll like that.</Page>
