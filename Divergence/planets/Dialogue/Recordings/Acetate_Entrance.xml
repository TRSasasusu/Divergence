			<Page>Uh, well... I guess now is the time that I start documenting everything that I do here, for posterity. No idea where I'm supposed to start. I'm guessing I would tell you how I got here, but you probably already know that, considering that you likely got here the same way I did.</Page>
			<Page>Pretty much blew up my ship trying to fly around this thing. Barely got out before the reactor went off. No idea if there's even anything left of it floating around out there. </Page>
			<Page>I'm telling you though, this thing is <![CDATA[<i>]]>massive<![CDATA[</i>]]>. I wonder who could've built it. It clearly wasn't made by the Nomai, and they're the only ones besides us that lived in this system, so this must've been built by a completely alien civilization. But where did they come from, and what were they doing here? How long has this been here without anyone knowing?</Page>
			<Page>First things first though, I wanted to head down to that <![CDATA[<color=orange>burned out building</color>]]> near the <![CDATA[<color=orange>tower</color>]]> that's down the river there. Might be a more central place to set up camp, though for now it might be best to stick to hanging around the entrances. At least until I can get into one of those ships downstairs.</Page>
			<Page>But man, talk about a good view. You don't get anything nearly this scenic on Timber Hearth. Can't wait to see how the others will react when I tell them the news.</Page>
