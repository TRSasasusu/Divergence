			<Page>Okay, so this is a bit of an interesting one. It seems that wherever this far away "satellite" is, it's still doing whatever it's doing, but the ability to directly control it from here is practically nonexistent.</Page>
			<Page>Of course, considering how damaged the controls are, I'm not sure they even <![CDATA[<i>]]>wanted<![CDATA[</i>]]> to control it, but that's got me thinking. Could there be another way to reestablish communication somehow? And, if so, are the means to do that locked away inside that vault?</Page>
			<Page>But the only way to get inside the vault is gone, isn't it? Did they really never intend on opening it again? I find it hard to believe that a species as advanced as this would go as far as to burn the codes in the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Cinder Isles</color>]]> without leaving any other way to get inside.</Page>
			<Page>I'll have to head back to the tower and have look at those codes again, but for now I'm going to focus on the vault itself. Maybe there's a non-obvious solution to opening it? I don't know. There has to be something I'm missing. Maybe I should sleep on it, see if I'm a bit more clear-headed tommorrow.</Page>
			<Page>Shame my ship is no longer in one piece. Guess my makeshift camp in the building at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>top of the damn</color>]]> will have do for now, at least until I'm done here. You don't realize how useful actually having a ship with a bunch of stuff in it is until you don't have it anymore.</Page>
