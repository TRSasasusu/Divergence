			<Page>I still don't exactly understand why they did a lot of the things that they did. Some of them I do, as strange as it sounds, but the rest of it still seems so foreign to me. </Page>
			<Page>Did it betray them? Was what they saw so terrible that they had no choice but to denounce it wholly and completely? They burned it all down, and hid it all away. Who were they trying to hide it from? Was what they were doing purely out of fear, or were they somehow justified?</Page>
